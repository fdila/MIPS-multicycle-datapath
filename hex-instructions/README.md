# Hex files

- `j.hex`: Jumps to 0x20 (= 0x8<<2).

- `lw.hex`: The number 0xF is stored in memory at 0xC. Load the number stored in 0xC in \$8.

- `sw.hex`: The number 0xF is stored in memory at 0xC. Load the number stored in 0xC in \$8. Store \$8 register in memory at 0x10.

- `add.hex`: The number 0xF is stored in memory at 0xC. The number 0x4 is stored in memory at 0x10. Load the two numbers from memory in \$8 and \$9. Add the two registers and store the result in \$10.

- `beq.hex`: Check if \$8 is equal to \$0. If true jump to PC(+4, as it is incremented in the fetch phase)+(0x8<<2).
