# MIPS-multicycle-datapath

MIPS multicycle datapath made in logisim evolution for the "Computers' Architecture" course @ [Universit√† degli studi di Milano-Bicocca](unimib.it), academic years 2020/2021, 2021/2022, 2022/2023, 2023/2024.

Datapath and FSM are taken from "Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, Mips Edition", 3rd edition.

This datapath implements:

- R-Type instructions (ADD, AND, SUB, SLT)

- Load Word

- Store Word

- Jump

- Branch Equal

NOTE: the current implementation only recognize overflow for ADD operations and could misbehave for SUB operations.

Repository structure:

- `slides`: here you can find the presentations used for the course, giving some hints on how to use this simulator.

- `truth-tables`: here you can find the truth tables used to generate the sub-circuits.

- `hex-instructions`: here you can find some example memory files to load in the RAM to see how the datapath works.

- `exercises`: here you can find  the solution to some exercises we made for the course. The aim of each exercise is to modify the datapath to implement a new instruction or exception. Thanks to [Simone Fontana](https://github.com/simone-fontana/), he made most of the work here, I just translated his work in logisim.
